Need sequence?


demo app:

- stores A, H, G
- identifier->object map (Perhaps identifiers[origin]: {identifier: object})
- relationships
  - relclass = <name, fwd, rev, recip, trans>
  - relation = <id1, id2, relname>
  - better: relation_sets = {name: <id1, id2>}


- HGVS -> A
- load, store as json, xml, proto
- versioning


Questions:

add A, H, G

add BI to each

define relationship types and instances between objects

genereate computed_identifier for each type


save, load stream as json, xml, protobuf
