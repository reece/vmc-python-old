VMC is the Variation Modelling Collaboration.  The VMC's mission is to
standardize the exchange of biological sequence variants among
computer systems.  The primary "products" of this effort are:

  #. A terminology document defining core elements of the data model.

  #. Machine-readable specifications for the data model.

This repository contains code to demonstrate the use fo the VMC data
model.
